**NOTE** Running Jarzilla currently requires the following steps:

  1. Open Security & Privacy Preferences
  2. Change setting "Allow applications downloaded from" to setting "Anywhere"
  3. Run Jarzilla
  4. Optionally, change security setting for gatekeeper back to 'Mac App Store & identified developers' to restore gatekeeper (This allows jarzilla to run, but keeps gatekeeper turned on)
